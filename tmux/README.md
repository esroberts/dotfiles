# TMUX

This is my TMUX configuration.

## Shell Alias
Set up this shell alias that will initiate your tmux session with your ideal console development
environment defined in `dev.conf`.
```
alias dev_tmux='tmux -f ~/dev.conf attach'
```

## dev.conf
This is where you set up your default windows and panes

## .tmux.conf
This file is where you put your key bindings, shortcuts, and look/feel that apply to 
all tmux sessions.
